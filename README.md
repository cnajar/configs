Own Configs

VIMRC
-----

This is how I configure VIM. But VIM can be a pain to configure, that's why I will describe how to get a powerful VIM environment set up


### Vundle

I user Vundle as extension managers. Vundle is short for Vim bundle and is a Vim plugin manager.
Letâ€™s get Vundle installed:

```
$ touch ~/.vimrc
$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle/
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Editing ~/.vimrc | Bla
